## Artificial Intelligence

is a part of the greater field of Computer Science that __enables computers to solve problems__ previously handled by biological systems. AI has many applications in today's society. NLP and ML are both parts of AI.

## Natural Language Processing
is a form of AI that gives machines the ability to not just read, but to __understand and interpret human language__. With NLP, machines can make sense of written or spoken text and perform tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization.

--

## Machine Learning 
is an application of AI that provides systems the ability to __automatically learn and improve from experience__ without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning can be used to help solve AI problems and to improve NLP by automating processes and delivering accurate responses.

## The Lorenz Equations

`\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}     &= \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y}     &= \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z}     &= -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned} \]`
